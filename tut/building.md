# Building MicroPython for ESP32

## ESP8266

For ESP8266, check out the build instructions at
https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp8266/README.md
and try and follow along.  There's quite a lot to download, especially during the
process of installing https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk


## ESP32

For ESP32 the build process is a little simpler, but check out
https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md
