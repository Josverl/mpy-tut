# Building MicroPython for ESP32

1. git clone https://github.com/nickzoic/mpy-tut
2. cd mpy-tut; git submodule update --init --recursive

This downloads a *lot* of content from github.  Most of this is the build environments for ESP32 and ESP8266.
If you're not interested in building MicroPython from source, or you've left your run a little bit late,
you could skip this ... the install instructions include how to install from binaries as well.
