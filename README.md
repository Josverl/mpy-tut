# MPY-TUT

This is the notes for the upcoming
[Getting Started with MicroPython Tutorial at LinuxConfAU 2018](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/42/)
which aims to introduce people to the very basics of [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) in an easy and accessible way.

There's a slightly more nicely formatted version of these pages availabe at [mpy-tut.zoic.org](http://mpy-tut.zoic.org/) ... 

It is based on material developed at [MicroPython Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/).

## The tutorial: what you need to know

The examples apply as far as possible to both the ESP8266 and the ESP32 ports of MicroPython.  

The [Open Hardware MiniConf](http://www.openhardwareconf.org/wiki/OHMC2018) will be constructing [LoliBot](https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/LoliBot)
robots based on the ESP32 and capable of running MicroPython, so if you're going to that as well bring yours along.

If you have your own ESP8266 or ESP32 development board to bring along, perhaps from the [PyConAU MicroPython Sprint](http://nick.zoic.org/art/micropython-sprints-pyconau/)
or from one of the many vendors out there, you're welcome to bring that along.

I'll also have a limited number of ESP8266-based boards along at the tutorial.  You can purchase one of these for $10 as part
of your LinuxConfAU registration ([under "Extras"](https://rego.linux.conf.au/tickets/category/7)).
Please provide your own MicroUSB cable (surely everyone has a pile of these?) and any dongles your computer needs to talk to it!

## Before the tutorial

### If you just want to try it out


### If you want to build MicroPython from source

There's a bunch of stuff to download which would have been a lot quicker if you'd done it earlier, rather than right now just as the tutorial is starting.  
So jump in your time machine and have a look at the first steps of Building MicroPython below.
