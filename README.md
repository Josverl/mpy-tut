This is the very start of a collection of documents forming a tutorial for
MicroPython development on ESP8266 / ESP32, as developed at
[MicroPython Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/)

This will evolve into the notes for the upcoming
[MicroPython Tutorial at LinuxConfAU 2018](https://rego.linux.conf.au/schedule/presentation/42/)
